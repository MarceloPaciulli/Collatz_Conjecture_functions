# Collatz_Conjecture_functions
The Collatz Conjecture is one of the simplest open problems to understand, but one of the most difficult to prove. Looking for patterns in any of your known charts is often a challenging task. One conception of the conjecture is to understand it as a function in terms of other functions such as the factorial, double factorial, and the gamma function, applicable to positive integers. Using the functools module and reduce command is central to this approach, where we search for a result after applying a calculation to a list of values or iterable.
