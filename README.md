# Collatz_Conjecture_functions
The Collatz Conjecture is one of the simplest open problems to understand, but the most difficult to prove. Looking for patterns in any of your known charts is often a challenging task. One conception of the conjecture is to understand it as a function in terms of other functions such as the factorial, double factorial, and the gamma function.
